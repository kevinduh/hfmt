The double Olympic team pursuit champion said: \"It's a huge honour - I can't quite believe it if I'm honest!\" Thomas, 32, has trained at the velodrome - the home of governing body Welsh Cycling - since it opened in 2003. He used the facility before the 2012 Olympics in London where he was part of a Team GB pursuit squad that defended their gold medal. Thomas also trained at the venue as part of his preparations for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, where he won two medals, including road race gold. This summer marked his greatest personal triumph when he emerged victorious after 21 stages around France. Thomas said: \"The Velodrome has played a pivotal part in my cycling story and continues to play such a key role in inspiring the next generation of cyclists in South Wales. \"It's a fantastic facility for riders of all ages and abilities to hone their talents. \"I would personally like to thank everyone who has played a part in this and look forward to seeing everyone for the grand opening.\" Thousands of people lined the streets of Cardiff earlier this month as Wales officially welcomed the cyclist home. He was congratulated by First Minister Carwyn Jones at the Senedd before cycling through the city centre to a ceremony outside Cardiff Castle in front of an estimated 8,000 fans. Newport Live, the charitable trust that runs the velodrome, said the venue has seen a \"significant increase\" in inquiries to use the track since Thomas' Tour success. Chairman John Harrhy said: \"We were all thrilled with Geraint's historic Tour de France victory and the board and our key partners were immediately unanimous in supporting the renaming of the velodrome in Geraint's honour.\" 'Entirely fitting' Having Thomas' name attached to the cycling centre will act as an inspiration for future riders, Mr Harrhy added. Thomas is due to return to Newport next month with Team Sky when the opening stage of the Tour of Britain finishes in the city on Sunday 2 September. Newport City Council leader Debbie Wilcox said: \"Geraint has spoken of what [the velodrome] has meant to him, so it is entirely fitting that Newport bestows this honour on him.\"", "summary": "Wales' National Velodrome will be renamed in honour of Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, it has been announced."}

The floods and landslides caused by torrential rains have killed at least 49 people across the country. The Red Cross says 100,000 people have been affected, with communications and electricity cut off in many areas. Pictures showed collapsed bridges and roads submerged or covered by debris from landslides, hampering the rescue efforts. Thousands of residents had been forced out of their houses in the hardest-hit areas, officials said, warning that the death toll could rise as at least 17 people were still missing. A hotel owner in Sauraha, 155km (96 miles) south-west of the capital, Kathmandu, said the elephants had been used to take the tourists to the nearest open road and airport.

{"text": "The conditions agreed by Tepco include massive cost-cutting, no upper limit for compensation payouts and accepting an investigation of its management. The move comes exactly two months after the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Earlier Tepco said it had found another leak of highly contaminated water into the sea but was able to halt the flow. A Tepco spokesman said workers stopped a leak into a storage pit, which lay outside reactor No 3 and within metres of the ocean. A similar leak at the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactor No 2 was sealed in April with a special chemical known as liquid glass. The plant has been leaking radiation since the 11 March earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged cooling systems at the six-reactor plant. More than 80,000 local residents living within a 20km (12 mile) radius of the plant have been evacuated from their homes. Agriculture and businesses have been hit and there is no timescale yet for allowing residents to return - Tepco has said that it may take up to nine months to achieve a cold shut-down at the plant. Tepco is seeking a 2 trillion yen ($24.8bn) loan to see it through the initial emergency. It also expects to pay 50 billion yen ($620m) in initial compensation to those evacuated around the plant. Overall damages are unknown but are expected to be much higher. The government is considering establishing a new body to deal with the payments in case they exceed Tepco's ability to pay. In a statement on Tuesday, the company said it faced \"an extremely severe situation\" in terms of raising funds and that it needed state help so that \"fair and prompt\" compensation could be paid to residents. Lifted spirits Two months since the twin natural disaster, people across the affected region held a moment of silence for the victims. Nearly 15,000 people are confirmed dead and more than 9,800 remain unaccounted for, according to the latest police figures.

Earlier on Wednesday Emperor Akihito and his wife visited evacuees living in a gymnasium in Fukushima City. Fukushima Mayor Takanori Seto said the imperial visit had lifted spirits. \"In reality, evacuees are going through serious pain. They want to go home. But in front of their majesties, they said 'Yes, we are OK.'

{"text": "Ministers said a further \u00a3500 would be made available to those without house insurance cover. Rhondda Cynon Taf council appealed for food donations to help more than 500 households that had suffered flooding. Key roads and rail lines remain shut, especially in mid Wales where there was fresh flooding on Monday. A number of former coal sites in south Wales are being monitored 24 hours a day following several landslides. First Minister Mark Drakeford said a \u00a310m fund set up by the Welsh Government would not be enough and the UK government needed to come up with cash to cover the cost of infrastructure damage. \"After a week of silence in the face of this emergency, we urgently need to hear what longer-term support communities can expect from the UK government,\" he said. The UK government said it would \"look seriously at any request\" from the Welsh Government for additional support and assistance for flood relief. In a statement, a spokesman said Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had met Mr Drakeford on Monday and \"reiterated the UK government's support for the affected communities\". He said the UK government had also ensured that any flood hardship payments made to individuals and families would not affect their eligibility for benefits issued by Department for Work and Pensions. Speaking in the House of Commons, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said a quarter of the families across the UK affected by floods lived in Rhondda Cynon Taf, and urged the UK government to help. He said many of his constituents \"have to choose between putting food on the table or paying the insurance\" and that Rhondda Cynon Taf council faced a \u00a330m bill to repair damage caused by the floods. Mr Bryant said: \"We need money from the government, we don't want talk of mutual aid. \"We need money and we need it now\". UK Environment Secretary George Eustice said if the Welsh Government approached the Wales Office with its concerns about funding then the matter could be considered. Responsibility for flooding is devolved. Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards also called for the UK government to give financial assistance to the Welsh Government for the communities hit by the floods. The centre of Pontypridd was left under water after the River Taff burst its banks last Sunday and thousands were affected around the county by widespread flooding. Two car dealerships in the town - Hutchings Motor Group and Greenaway Autos - were flooded when the River Taff burst its banks, leading to about 300 new and used cars being written off. Now Welsh Labour politicians have called on the new chancellor for a one-off grant of \u00a330m to help pay for repair and restoration work across Rhondda Cynon Taff. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, they also called for council tax and business rates to be suspended for a year in affected properties. Council chiefs estimate \u00a330m of infrastructure damage in Rhondda Cynon Taff alone - with the bill for private properties across the county \"likely to run to nearly \u00a3150m pounds,\" according to Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan. The Welsh Government funds flood defences, flood clear-ups and funding to local authorities, but tax relief is a UK government call. \"Wales took the brunt of the force of this storm and we would be wiping out all of our financial resources in one of the poorest areas of the country,\" Mr Bryant told BBC Radio Wales. \"In the normal course of things this would be funded by the Welsh Government. \"But you would be wiping out the entire capital allocation just by dealing with the problems in Rhondda Cynon Taff. That would mean no other work on things like schools for example. \"They have announced lots of extra money in England but there isn't a single consequential penny for Wales, which is the hardest hit part of the UK. \"The whole point of the 'United Kingdom' is that if one part of the UK suffers then the whole of the United Kingdom should step in to help.\" Mr Bryant added he thinks Westminster \"is open to the idea\" for extra funding but wants the UK government to \"step up\". Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor If you've been flooded, you want help. You don't really care where it comes from. Being flooded is traumatic and it takes time and money to recover. In these Labour heartlands, if people feel they've been abandoned there could be a backlash in the assembly elections next May. The politicians who wrote the letter to the chancellor want extra money from the UK government. But a lot of what they're asking for is legally the responsibility of the Welsh Government. The UK government has promised extra money to flooded local authorities in England because they are responsible for funding councils there. In Wales, local councils are funded by the Welsh Government which has promised ten million pounds for immediate relief, with more to come. Reserves exist for emergencies, should the Welsh Government use theirs to shoulder the full cost? Or is this an extraordinary situation, where the UK government should step in? In politics, the answer to the question \"Who pays?\" is never straightforward. About 550 homes were flooded across the county and Rhondda council bosses say they \"currently have 50 families in temporary accommodation\". \"The amount of damage is just something we haven't seen on this scale before,\" said Mr Morgan. \"A lot of families don't have insurance and some businesses are being told by their insurance companies they aren't covered. \"Unless we have additional support families will be out of their homes for sometime, businesses could fold and people could lose their jobs.\" Crowdfunding pages have already raised thousands for the flood-hit communities and a Valley Aid fundraising concert has been announced for next month, where Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield and Grammy award winner Amy Wadge will headline. Film star Michael Sheen and Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones have between them raised more than \u00a380,000 in online campaigns. A collection at Saturday's Six Nations rugby game between Wales and France at the Principality Stadium raised \u00a312,000, the Welsh Rugby Union said. A UK government spokesperson said: \"Whilst flood defences and the response to flooding in Wales are devolved, we will continue to engage with and support the Welsh Government on flood relief and coal tip safety.\" The Department for Work and Pensions have confirmed that flood hardship payments will \"not affect eligibility for benefits.\" What's happening in other parts of Wales? In mid Wales, delivery driver Mike Jones told how he was struck by floodwater while on the A458 near Welshpool, Powys, on Monday. He said: \"All of a sudden from my left the river burst its banks and it came through the hedge out in front of me. \"A big wave came across the front of the van and I just about got through but unfortunately it got into the engines\u2026 it was a bit scary.\" A full Powys council meeting on Friday will reveal what the cost of the recent storms has been to the county and what can be done to help those affected. Councillor John Morris, who represents Crickhowell - one of the worst hit areas of the county - said: \"In my area alone over 30 residential properties were affected and about the same number of businesses. \"This includes the Elvicta Trading Estate on the outskirts of Crickhowell with its 20 or so businesses and is a major employer in the area.\" Caereinion High School near Welshpool, Powys, closed on Monday because flooded roads are preventing some teachers and pupils from getting in. Meanwhile, running water to a town marooned by flooding has been restored after almost a week without supply on Monday. Tankers and bottled water had supplied residents in Monmouth after the town's Mayhill treatment works was shut after becoming submerged after the Rivers Monnow and Wye burst their banks.", "summary": "As Wales braces for more flooding, the Welsh Government has announced it will give at least \u00a3500 to every affected household."}
